# **App Name**: Pixel XP Habit Battle

## Core Features:

- Retro Pixel UI: Displays a retro pixel-art UI with side-by-side XP bars for the User and AI Rival, and a task list with checkboxes.
- Daily Quest List: Task list displays daily quests with title, XP value, and completion status, using checkboxes to indicate task completion.
- Real-Time XP Update: Visually indicates XP progress in real-time with updating XP bars.
- AI Rival XP Adaptation: AI Rival dynamically adjusts XP based on the user's incomplete quests. The AI tool determines XP gain for the Rival based on how much time remains to complete outstanding quests, using configurable weights, in order to emulate the behaviour of a real competitor, but does not use external data to do so.
- XP Distribution Logic: When a quest is checked, the userâ€™s XP bar immediately increases. Rival gains XP over the time the quest is not completed.
